Take a photo or movie with your iPhone and mail it to a server or website of your own.  No need for the Cloud or a third party site.

Supported phones: iPhone 1 and newer.

History: Originally took data from a Sony Erickson 615 and pushed it out. Now it functions with images from an iPhone. Future support may include other phones (android/blackberry). 

2.0 added ability to rotate image based on EXIF data in image as due to changes in IOS 3.0 and greater, images are now saved with the rotation/orientation information in the EXIF information.   

Requirements: mpack, jpegtran and exifprobe.  You also need to be able to pipe/filter your email to the umbrella.sh script. All three utilities are available via the FreeBSD ports/pkg utilities.  For other operating systems, please check accordingly. 

To use this script:  
* Place umbrella.sh in a directory that is not within /home/www or where ever your website lives.
* Edit umbrella.sh and replace the values for all variables necessary 
* Create a directory named Umbrella within your site file (ie /home/www/$TLD/Umbrella) 
* Move index.php to the directory you have created. 
* Edit index.php and replace the values for all variables necessary 
* Touch feed.xml and old.xml 
* Move placeholder.txt and placeholder.jpg to your working directory (These are used if something goes wrong.)
* Create a mail filter to pass incoming messages to umbrella.sh (You will want to filter by both sending/receiving address and possibly other variables to insure basic security.)

See the contents of the sample directory to perform tests prior to launching.  Once tests are successful, delete feed.xml and old.xml and being your blogging.
